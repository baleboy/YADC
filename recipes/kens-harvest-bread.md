# Harvest Bread with Poolish

*Makes 2 loaves (about 1½ lb / ~680 g each)*  
*Suitable for focaccia*

---

## Overview

This hearty **harvest bread** contains **10 percent whole wheat flour**, along with wheat germ and a bit of wheat bran.  
The result is a bread with more flavor and nutrition than white bread, while still remaining light and versatile.

If you like, you can increase the whole wheat percentage slightly, but be aware that doing so will require extra water in the dough. Either way, this poolish-based dough imparts a **buttery flavor** that marries well with the added grains.
