# White Bread with Poolish

*Makes 2 loaves, each about 1½ lb (≈680 g)*  
*Suitable for bread, baguettes, focaccia, and soft pizza dough*

---

## Overview

This recipe produces a **palate-sparkling, almost buttery-flavored white bread** with a thin, crisp crust. Extremely versatile, it works beautifully for sandwiches, toast, dinner bread, baguettes, focaccia, and even soft pizza dough.

To make this bread, begin **the evening before baking** by mixing a *poolish* — a simple mixture of flour, water, and a very small amount of yeast. This takes only a few minutes.

By morning, the poolish will be **bubbly and gassy** (with a pleasantly goopy texture) and ready to be mixed with the remaining flour, water, salt, and yeast.

There is **no autolyse stage** in this recipe. After mixing the poolish, so little water remains for the final dough that the flour would clump and be difficult to work by hand.

### Shaping Note
The dough is especially nice shaped into a **fendue loaf**:  
Take the fully proofed loaf, flour it, then press a dowel down the center all the way to the work surface to create a seam. The result is a kidney-shaped loaf with two large lobes of crusty bread joined in the middle.
