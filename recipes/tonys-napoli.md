# Napoletana Dough

*Makes 28 ounces (795 g) dough — enough for three 9–10 oz dough balls*

---

## Overview

An authentic **Napoletana pizza** is made with Italian *doppio zero* (00) flour.  
“Double zero” refers to the fineness of the grind (from 2 = coarsest to 00 = finest).

00 flour is milled from **soft wheat**, which has less elastic gluten than hard wheat.  
The result is a **tender dough** that requires a light touch and gentle handling.

The two most revered 00 flour brands for Neapolitan pizza are **Caputo** and **San Felice** — often described as the *Coke and Pepsi of Naples*. Both are excellent, though Caputo is easier to find in American supermarkets.

This recipe uses **fresh yeast**, which is the traditional Neapolitan method.

The only difference between the wood-fired and home-oven versions of this dough is the addition of a small amount of **diastatic malt** in the home-oven version to help with browning. With the intense heat of a wood-fired oven, malt is unnecessary.

- **210 g ice water** (¾ cup + 2 Tbsp)

## Method

### 1. Activate the Yeast
1. Put the yeast in a small bowl.
2. Add the warm water.
3. Whisk vigorously for **30 seconds**.

The yeast should dissolve and the mixture should foam.  
If it does not foam and the yeast granules float, the yeast is **dead** — discard and start again with fresh yeast and water.

### 2. Initial Mixing
1. Combine the flour and malt (if using) in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a **dough hook**.
2. With the mixer running on the **lowest speed**, pour in most of the ice water, reserving about **2 tablespoons**.
3. Add the yeast–water mixture.
4. Pour the reserved water into the yeast bowl, swirl to dislodge any remaining yeast, and add it to the mixer.
5. Mix for about **15 seconds**, then add the poolish.

### 3. Form the Dough
1. Continue mixing on the **lowest speed** for about **1 minute**, until most of the dough comes together around the hook.
2. Stop the mixer.
3. Use your fingers to pull away any dough clinging to the hook.
4. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a bowl scraper or rubber spatula.
