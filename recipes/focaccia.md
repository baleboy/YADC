## Ingredients

### Dough
- **500 g flour 0** (medium-strength bread flour)  
- **340 g water**, at room temperature  
- **7 g fresh brewer’s yeast**, crumbled  
- **25 g extra-virgin olive oil**, for the dough  
- **10 g fine salt**

### For topping
- **60 g extra-virgin olive oil**
- **Maldon salt (or coarse sea salt), to taste**

## Instructions

### 1. Mix the Dough
1. In a large bowl, add the flour.  
2. Add the crumbled fresh yeast.  
3. Pour in the water **a little at a time**, mixing as you go so the flour absorbs it evenly.  
4. When all the water is incorporated and the dough has some body, transfer it to your work surface. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 2. Knead
5. Knead with energy using the back of your hands, folding and pushing the dough — like you would with fresh pasta — turning it 90° each time.  
6. As the dough firms, gradually add the **25 g olive oil** in 3–4 additions, working it into the dough.  
7. Once the oil is incorporated, add **all the salt** at once and continue kneading until fully absorbed. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### 3. Rest and Strengthen
8. Cover the dough with a bowl and let it **rest for 15 minutes**; this helps the gluten develop.  
9. After resting, perform **slap & fold** type folds: lift the dough with both hands and slap it onto the surface, then rotate 180° and repeat 2–3 times.  
10. Let rest 15 minutes, then repeat this cycle once more. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### 4. First Rise
11. Oil a clean bowl with olive oil, place the dough inside, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise at **room temperature (26–28°C)** for about **3 hours**, until it **triples in volume**. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### 5. Shape
12. Oil a baking pan (≈25×38 cm) well.  
13. Transfer the risen dough to the pan and gently stretch it with your hands to fill the entire surface.  
14. If the dough pulls back, cover it and let it relax for 5 minutes, then continue stretching. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### 6. Second Rise
15. Cover the pan with plastic or a damp cloth and **let rise for 1 hour**.  
16. Drizzle **60 g olive oil** over the dough, then press your fingertips to make the classic focaccia dimples. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

### 7. Bake
17. Preheat the oven to **200°C (about 390°F)**.  
18. Sprinkle with Maldon or coarse salt to taste.  
19. Bake on the **lower rack** for about **30 minutes**, until golden and cooked through.  
20. Serve hot or warm. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Tips & Notes

- The dough is quite wet and soft — don’t be alarmed; this is typical for focaccia. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Letting the dough rest between folds helps develop structure without over-kneading. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- You can garnish with rosemary or other toppings after dimpling if desired.  
- Focaccia is best eaten fresh but can be kept in a bag for up to 2 days; warm before serving. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
